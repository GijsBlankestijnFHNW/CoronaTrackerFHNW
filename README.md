## Context
This project is the work of 2 students: Jonathan Opsomer and Gijs Blankenstijn. Whilst following an IT course at the FHNW - Switzerland we were obliged to develop a certain webapp with certain specifications and an actual useful business case. Therefore we thought it would be interesting to develop this Covid-19 tracker. As this web-app could actually be sold to restaurants etc,.
